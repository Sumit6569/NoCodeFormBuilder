## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Bm_infoTechAssingment
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up MongoDB**

   **Option A: Local MongoDB**

   - Install MongoDB on your machine
   - Start MongoDB service
   - The app will connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017/dynamic-forms`

   **Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)**

   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account
   - Create a new cluster
   - Get your connection string
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     PORT=3001
     ```

   **Option C: Docker (Easiest)**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the frontend (http://localhost:5175) and backend (http://localhost:3001) concurrently.
npm run dev

```

This will start both the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 3001) simultaneously.

### Available Scripts
